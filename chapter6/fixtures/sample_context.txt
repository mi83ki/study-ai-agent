Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. As the diversity and complexity of agents continue to grow, addressing these resource management issues becomes increasingly critical to LLM-based agent systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) and efficient management of resources (e.g., LLM and external tools) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS-Agent SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel.

  - The paper introduces the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) to address the challenges faced by LLM-based intelligent agents, particularly in resource management. It states, "LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents." This highlights the dilemma of uncontrolled resource access, which can result in inefficiencies or abuses by agents.

  - Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the limitations of existing agent frameworks: "System-level resources such as LLMs and tools... are typically treated as direct inputs to agents, granting agents explicit access and control. Such implementations can compromise optimal resource utilization and potentially expose the system to vulnerabilities if some agents exploit the resources." The text emphasizes the need for structured resource management to ensure that agents can operate efficiently without monopolizing resources or causing failures in the system.

  - The proposed AIOS architecture separates agent applications from the resources they utilize, which is crucial for enhancing efficiency and safety. According to the authors, "This architecture divides agent applications and their accessible resources such as LLMs and tools into distinct layers, i.e., the application layer and the kernel layer." This layered approach allows for better management and optimization of resource usage.

  - The paper also discusses the implementation of the AIOS kernel, which includes an agent scheduler, memory management, and access control: "In this kernel, agent primitives are designed to decompose LLM-related queries into sub execution units to enhance concurrency." This suggests that the AIOS kernel is designed to improve the performance of LLM-based agents by allowing them to execute tasks concurrently rather than sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that AIOS can achieve up to "2.1× faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks," showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed system.

One important application of LLM is LLM-based AI Agent, which leverages the ability of LLM as well as external tools for complex-task solving. To make sure LLM Agents follow an effective and reliable procedure to solve the given task, manually designed workflows are usually used to guide the working mechanism of agents. However, manually designing the workflows requires considerable efforts and domain knowledge, making it difficult to develop and deploy agents on massive scales. To address these issues, we propose AutoFlow, a framework designed to automatically generate workflows for agents to solve complex tasks.

  - The paper presents a detailed architecture for an AI agent designed specifically for error resolution in computational notebooks. The system consists of three main components: an agent, an environment, and a user interface. The agent acts as a stateful back-end service that facilitates communication between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the notebook environment. It is responsible for orchestrating the resolution process of runtime exceptions by storing interaction history and converting LLM predictions into actionable steps within the notebook.

  

  - The AI agent was built using the GPT-4-0613 foundation model, which was selected for its reliable performance in generating function calls. The design includes a memory stack that stores the history of previous interactions and observations from the notebook environment. The agent engages in a strategy of reflection, prompting the LLM to consider the outcomes of past actions before deciding on the next step. The agent can create, edit, and execute cells in the notebook, allowing it to interactively explore the environment and resolve errors in a manner similar to a human user.

  - The environment is described as a fully functional computational notebook that supports various features such as Python execution, inline plotting, and markdown support. The notebook environment is augmented with tools that enable the agent to perform actions like creating and executing cells, allowing for exploration beyond the immediate context of the notebook.

  - The authors emphasize the importance of avoiding "hacks" in error resolution—actions that merely circumvent the issue rather than addressing the root cause. The system is structured to encourage the agent to explore the environment iteratively for a more effective resolution process.

  - **From Section 5.2: Large Language Model Agents**:

    "LLM-based single-agent systems (SAS) use a single LLM agent for complex task solving, such as travel planning (Xie et al., 2024), personalized recommendation, and artistic design (Ge et al., 2023a). The agent takes natural language instruction from users as input and decomposes the task into a multistep plan for task solving, where each step may call external tools to be completed, such as collecting information, executing specialized models, or interacting with the external world."

    "For example, agents in virtual or digital environments may invoke APIs (Ge et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2023; Yao & Narasimhan, 2023; Parisi et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), browse websites (Nakano et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024), or execute codes (Zhang et al., 2023; Yang et al.), while agents in the physical environment may manipulate objects (Brohan et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a), carry out lab experiments (Boiko et al., 2023; Bran et al., 2023), or make actionable decisions (Huang et al., 2022; Xiang et al., 2023)."

    - Based on the above quotes, LLM-based agents have applications across various fields. They can solve complex tasks such as travel planning, personalized recommendations, and artistic design, indicating their versatility in service-oriented roles. Moreover, they can function in both digital (like invoking APIs or browsing websites) and physical environments (like manipulating objects or conducting lab experiments), showcasing their functionality in diverse contexts ranging from virtual assistance to physical tasks in real-world settings.

Using the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity.

  - The paper presents three main generalizations regarding personality-endowed LLMs in negotiation contexts. The first generalization notes that "more agreeable agents have the highest payoffs but are exploitable by less agreeable agents." This suggests that while agreeable agents can successfully negotiate with a wide range of customers, they are vulnerable to being taken advantage of by those who are less agreeable. 

  - The second generalization emphasizes that "the behavior of these agents are generally fair rather than rational." This indicates that the negotiation strategies employed by these agents often prioritize fairness over achieving the best possible outcome, which can lead to irrational behaviors such as rejecting final offers and thus losing potential utility. 

  - The third generalization provides insights into the design of negotiation bots, stating that "bots with fairness-based arguments will be able to reach more deals while bots with rational arguments will extract increased value." This highlights the importance of the personality traits programmed into negotiation bots, where assertive language can enhance both agreement rates and value extraction. However, it also warns that more aggressive personalities may create a toxic negotiating environment, necessitating a careful balance between assertiveness and aggression.

  - The paper introduces the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) to address the challenges faced by LLM-based intelligent agents, particularly in resource management. It states, "LLM-based intelligent agents face significant deployment challenges, particularly related to resource management. Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents." This highlights the dilemma of uncontrolled resource access, which can result in inefficiencies or abuses by agents.

  - Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the limitations of existing agent frameworks: "System-level resources such as LLMs and tools... are typically treated as direct inputs to agents, granting agents explicit access and control. Such implementations can compromise optimal resource utilization and potentially expose the system to vulnerabilities if some agents exploit the resources." The text emphasizes the need for structured resource management to ensure that agents can operate efficiently without monopolizing resources or causing failures in the system.

  - The proposed AIOS architecture separates agent applications from the resources they utilize, which is crucial for enhancing efficiency and safety. According to the authors, "This architecture divides agent applications and their accessible resources such as LLMs and tools into distinct layers, i.e., the application layer and the kernel layer." This layered approach allows for better management and optimization of resource usage.

  - The paper also discusses the implementation of the AIOS kernel, which includes an agent scheduler, memory management, and access control: "In this kernel, agent primitives are designed to decompose LLM-related queries into sub execution units to enhance concurrency." This suggests that the AIOS kernel is designed to improve the performance of LLM-based agents by allowing them to execute tasks concurrently rather than sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that AIOS can achieve up to "2.1× faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks," showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed system.

  - The paper outlines the design methods of AI agents used in the context of co-creative systems, particularly in the area of game level design. The authors conducted studies comparing various machine learning (ML) approaches, specifically mentioning three distinct ML-based AI partners: "an LSTM, a Markov Chain, and a Bayes Net." The researchers aimed to understand user perceptions of these AI agents and how their designs influenced co-creative interactions.

  

  - "In the first study interface... allowed users to interact with one of three distinct ML-based AI partners in the backend: an LSTM, a Markov Chain, and a Bayes Net." The framework also mentions the evolution of the interface, noting that they removed certain user abilities and introduced features like the ability to ask for explanations of the AI agent's actions and an undo button for the user's actions.

  - The AI agents were designed with different algorithms, influencing how users perceived their creativity and usability. The results indicated that "the Bayes Net produced less changes per action compared to the LSTM or Markov Chain," suggesting that the design of these agents directly affected the user experience.

  - The paper states, "Including active learning as a non-turn action for the Deep RL AI agent improved simulated test performance," highlighting the importance of incorporating learning mechanisms that adapt based on user interactions.

    - In simple terms, the research focused on how different AI algorithms (like LSTM, Markov Chain, and Bayes Net) were designed to assist users in creating game levels. By adjusting the AI's capabilities, such as allowing it to learn from user feedback or providing explanations for its actions, researchers aimed to enhance the collaborative experience between human users and AI.

  - The paper presents a detailed architecture for an AI agent designed specifically for error resolution in computational notebooks. The system consists of three main components: an agent, an environment, and a user interface. The agent acts as a stateful back-end service that facilitates communication between the Large Language Model (LLM) and the notebook environment. It is responsible for orchestrating the resolution process of runtime exceptions by storing interaction history and converting LLM predictions into actionable steps within the notebook.

  

  - The AI agent was built using the GPT-4-0613 foundation model, which was selected for its reliable performance in generating function calls. The design includes a memory stack that stores the history of previous interactions and observations from the notebook environment. The agent engages in a strategy of reflection, prompting the LLM to consider the outcomes of past actions before deciding on the next step. The agent can create, edit, and execute cells in the notebook, allowing it to interactively explore the environment and resolve errors in a manner similar to a human user.

  - The environment is described as a fully functional computational notebook that supports various features such as Python execution, inline plotting, and markdown support. The notebook environment is augmented with tools that enable the agent to perform actions like creating and executing cells, allowing for exploration beyond the immediate context of the notebook.

  - The authors emphasize the importance of avoiding "hacks" in error resolution—actions that merely circumvent the issue rather than addressing the root cause. The system is structured to encourage the agent to explore the environment iteratively for a more effective resolution process.

Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. As the diversity and complexity of agents continue to grow, addressing these resource management issues becomes increasingly critical to LLM-based agent systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents.

  - **From Section 5.2: Large Language Model Agents**:

    "LLM-based single-agent systems (SAS) use a single LLM agent for complex task solving, such as travel planning (Xie et al., 2024), personalized recommendation, and artistic design (Ge et al., 2023a). The agent takes natural language instruction from users as input and decomposes the task into a multistep plan for task solving, where each step may call external tools to be completed, such as collecting information, executing specialized models, or interacting with the external world."

    "For example, agents in virtual or digital environments may invoke APIs (Ge et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2023; Yao & Narasimhan, 2023; Parisi et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024), browse websites (Nakano et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024), or execute codes (Zhang et al., 2023; Yang et al.), while agents in the physical environment may manipulate objects (Brohan et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023a), carry out lab experiments (Boiko et al., 2023; Bran et al., 2023), or make actionable decisions (Huang et al., 2022; Xiang et al., 2023)."

    - Based on the above quotes, LLM-based agents have applications across various fields. They can solve complex tasks such as travel planning, personalized recommendations, and artistic design, indicating their versatility in service-oriented roles.

Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies.

  - The paper presents three main generalizations regarding personality-endowed LLMs in negotiation contexts. The first generalization notes that "more agreeable agents have the highest payoffs but are exploitable by less agreeable agents." This suggests that while agreeable agents can successfully negotiate with a wide range of customers, they are vulnerable to being taken advantage of by those who are less agreeable. 

  - The second generalization emphasizes that "the behavior of these agents are generally fair rather than rational." This indicates that the negotiation strategies employed by these agents often prioritize fairness over achieving the best possible outcome, which can lead to irrational behaviors such as rejecting final offers and thus losing potential utility. 

  - The third generalization provides insights into the design of negotiation bots, stating that "bots with fairness-based arguments will be able to reach more deals while bots with rational arguments will extract increased value." This highlights the importance of the personality traits programmed into negotiation bots, where assertive language can enhance both agreement rates and value extraction. However, it also warns that more aggressive personalities may create a toxic negotiating environment, necessitating a careful balance between assertiveness and aggression.
